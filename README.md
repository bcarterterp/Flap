## Philosophy

- Code is organic, and changes frequently, so as a team we should be aligned on how it grows, and is maintained. The base architecture should be built keeping [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) in mind. Allowing for flexibility when needed, but also dependable. It should be easy for newer people to ramp up, because no one likes to spend a month just to start contributing. Everyone has ownership of the codebase. Take a look [here](https://www.tatvasoft.com/outsourcing/2022/05/software-development-principles.html) for more direction!
- All ideas are welcomed, and no one person should override the consensus. Change is inevitable, so be flexible to change! Make sure to keep constant communication with your teammates, and any large sweeping changes should have an RFC in Confluence

## Getting Started With Flutter

If this is your first flutter project, don't worry, we will help you through it! Below are some great resources to get caught up to speed

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Architecture

Our architecture stems from [Flutter - Clean Architecture](https://github.com/guilherme-v/flutter-clean-architecture-example). We found this architecture to allow for ease of use and flexibility. You should be in good hands with it's documentation. Any changes we make that diverge from the proposed architecture should be noted here.

## Libraries and Frameworks Used

- State Management: [Flutter Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/)
- Navigation: [go_router] (https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
- Fonts: [Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- Change App Package Name: [Name Change](https://pub.dev/packages/change_app_package_name) Allows you to change the project name through terminal instead of doing it manually. Feel free to remove it after forking!

## Style Guide

- Lint has been set to the [default](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style) for Flutter/Dart. Feel free to make your own changes
- Naming Conventions:
  - Screens are the widgets you will display to the user and navigate to and from.
  - ScreenStates are the data that backs the Screens 
  - Notifiers are the glue connecting state change and the UseCases
  - UseCases contain the core business logic and coordinate the flow of data between the notifier and repositories
  - Repositories are in charge of doing some sort of specialty work (Network, Cache, Etc)


## Navigation

go_router is a declarative routing package helpful for advanced navigation requirements (such as a web app that uses direct links to each screen or an app with multiple "navigation graphs" or navigation widgets). This package was mentioned here in the flutter docs: https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation
